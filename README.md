# Clustering Methods

This repository contains R codes about Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM) and Cluster-Weighted Model(CWM).
GMM is a probabilistic clustering method by assuming distribution to the covariates. Each observation have probability of being included in each cluster. This leads better performance than distance-based clustering methods(like K-means).

CWM is a clustering method about the relationship between a response variable Y and explanatory variables X. While GMM focuses on the distribution of X, CWM focuses on the joint probability distribution f(x,y)
