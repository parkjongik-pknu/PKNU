# Clustering Methods

This repository contains R codes about Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM) and Cluster-Weighted Model(CWM).
GMM is a probabilistic clustering method by assuming distribution to the covariates. Each observation have probability of being included in each cluster. This leads better performance than distance-based clustering methods(like K-means).

CWM is a clustering method about the relationship between a response variable Y and explanatory variables X. While GMM focuses on the distribution of X, CWM focuses on the joint probability distribution f(x,y)

This repository contains GMM and CWM implementation in R.

HOW TO USE:

In GMM
clustering_gmm <- function(X, g=6, max_iter=200, tol=1e-6, init_methods="kmeans")

X : Data you want to use in clustering analysis(explanatory variables)
g : The number of cluster(if you choose 6, there is one cluster, two clusters, ... up to six clusters)
init_methods : you can choose "kmeans", "kmedoids", "heirarchical"

In CWM
clustering_cwm <- function(X, Y, g=6, max_iter=200, tol=1e-6, init_method="kmeans")

X : a explanatory variables you want to use in clustering analysis
Y : response variables you want to use in clustering analysis
g : The number of cluster(if you choose 6, there is one cluster, two clusters, ... up to six clusters)
init_methods : you can choose "kmeans", "kmedoids", "heirarchical"
