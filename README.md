# Clustering Methods

These are R codes about Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM) and Cluster-Weighted Model(CWM).
GMM is a probabilistic clustering method by assuming distribution to the covariates. Each observation have probability of being included in each cluster. This leads better performance than distance-based clustering methods like K-means, etc.

CWM is a clustering method about the relationship between response variable Y and explanatory variables X.
